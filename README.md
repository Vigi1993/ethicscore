# EthicPrint

**Discover the ethical impact of the brands you use every day.**

## Why this exists

After watching the film *The Voice of Hind Rajab*. After the massacre at the school in Minab. After yet more innocent victims of war.

Not just the helplessness in front of these facts — but the idea of being complicit. Of using brands out of convenience, brands that with the money earned from my convenience sponsor or even directly participate in these massacres.

That's why I decided to try to do something. Not to change the world. But at least to change my world.

— *Marco Viglianti, 2025*

## What is EthicPrint

EthicPrint is a free, open source, community-driven tool that lets you measure the ethical impact of the brands, platforms, and services you use every day.

For each brand, EthicPrint assigns a score across four dimensions:

| Dimension | What it measures |
|---|---|
| ⚔️ Conflicts & Arms | Contracts with military, arms exports, operations in conflict zones |
| 🌿 Environment & CO₂ | Emissions, climate commitments, energy transition |
| ✊ Human Rights | Labour conditions, supply chain, operations under authoritarian regimes |
| ⚖️ Tax & Transparency | Tax avoidance, offshore structures, fiscal transparency |

You can build your personal list of brands and get an aggregated ethical score — your **EthicPrint** — along with suggestions for more ethical alternatives where your score falls below the threshold.

## Principles

- **No profit.** EthicPrint will never be monetised. No ads, no paid placements, no sponsored scores.
- **Radical transparency.** Every score is documented with sources. Every change is public, dated and signed.
- **Community driven.** Anyone can propose new brands or corrections — but every change requires verified sources and is reviewed before being accepted.
- **Methodological honesty.** We don't claim to have the definitive truth. Scores are based on the best available public information and are updated as new information emerges.

## How scores are calculated

See [METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md) for the full explanation of how scores are calculated, which sources are accepted, and how the weighting works.
